# Covid-19 In Lithuanian

**Covid-19 In lithuanian language** is a website which displays global and national covid-19 cases data history in
simple manner. It targets lithuanian speaking audience.

## DEMO

https://tadassapitavicius.com/corona/

## Why this website exists ?

There are many lithuanians who do not understand english or other languages, so this project is for them.
I scouted all over the web while searching for global Covid-19 statistics in lithuanian language.
All I found was national cases, news articles, or unprocessed data, so I decided to create a dedicated website just for that.
